# Vanilla Web Basics

A repository to go over the basics of (mostly) vanilla web, to refresh my skills and get back into coding & web development.

## Frameworks
Currently just using fontawesome for the icons.

Will not be using any JS frameworks like React. Might use some css framework like bootstrap or fomantic ui to speed up development when things get more complex but so far I'm enjoying doing the css from scratch myself, and it's definitely helping with my CSS fluency.
