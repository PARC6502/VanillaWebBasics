# Basic Todo

Compared to what I've done so far with the CardCreator and CardDeleter, there isn't too much new that this BasicTodo adds. Mostly it's just been a bit of extra practice, more playing around with styling and reinforcing the techniques I'm brushing up on. This page is a tad more complex than the others too, but still pretty simple overall.

The couple extra things it uses:

* A manual update function that checks state of all items and performs action based on a couple of variables (`updateItemHide()` function)
* CSS `grayscale()` filter
