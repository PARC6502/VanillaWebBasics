# Drag and Drop API basics

Implements a draggable div using the [Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API).

Note: I think that for this use case (dragging an element across the screen) it would be better to implement with `onmousedown`,`onmouseup` and `onmousemove`
